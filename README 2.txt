Please read carefully the lulu cover FAQ.

Checklist:
- Use cover.xls to calculate the spine size and total dimensions based on the page count
- If the dimensions change, you will have to change the Page Setup of cover.graffle
and cover-template.graffle.  Right now it is 32.83cm x 23.50 cm for a 0.68cm spine (300 pages).
- Be sure that the the cover art and spine text are properly centered.  Use the skeleton in cover-template.graffle as an overlay to see where stuff will appear. (Copy and paste it to cover.graffle to check the layout, then delete it.) Note that the skeleton also shows the bleed area, which will be chopped off in the printing process.
- Be sure to update the version number of the cover!
- Lulu recommends you to use photoshop to rasterize the PDF to be sure that the cover will print ok.  Export the canvas as PDF from OmniGraffle as cover.pdf.  Open it with PhotoShop at 300 dpi with RGB encoding, and save it as cover-photoshop.pdf with maximum JPEG encoding.  You can then upload this file to lulu.
